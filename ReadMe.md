# The Roleplay Game

## Description
The game is a simplified rpg, which includes three type of heroes. Namely Mage, Ranger and Warrior. 
These heroes can equip different kind of armoursets and weapons. All of these heroes have different skillsets
in regards to their properties. For instance a warrior has more strength than a mage, 
however a mage has more intelligence than a warrior.
This game was constructed so that I could try out some of the 
design principles, in this case I tried to use the principle Factory to my best ability.
